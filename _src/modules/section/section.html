                    <p>While interior <a href="" title="">asdsadsd</a> painting jobs can range from a large to small scale depending on the rooms the benefits to be enjoyed from an interior painting job are numerous. For those seeking to do some remodeling, a new color on the walls or a fresh coat on your trim is a great place to start. Not only will new paint reflect new light into the room and accentuate new furnishing, but it can also create its own unique atmosphere to the space. Neutral wall tones will make a room feel warmer, while brighter tones give off a more vibrant and energetic tone.</p>

                    <p>Interior painting has practical purposes also. Painting your walls, ceiling, and trim can help to reduce dust and dirt buildup over time as your walls and plaster age and flake. Walls can also take a beating over time. A good paint job can not only hide marks and stains, but can provide resistance to additional scuffing and scratching, and prolong your walls’ lifespan. The protective coat can also protect walls from absorbing moisture and experiencing mold and decay.</p>

                    <p>A home with an old paint job can start to look run down and old over time. Not only is it less satisfying to call home, but its exterior is very vulnerable to the elements. Having an exterior painting job done, even if it’s just a trim touch-up, can dramatically increase your home value and curb appeal. Painting a fresh color on the outside of your house will help protect it against stains and dirt buildup.</p>

                    <p>The outside of your house experiences more wear than you might expect. Constant exposure to the elements makes it susceptible to wind, sun, rain, snow, and ice. While exposed wood will only last for so long, a paint job can help protect against the elements and decrease the amount of weather damage your home experiences over time.</p>
